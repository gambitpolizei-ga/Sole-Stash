# Sole Stash
Developed by TJ Roncal on May 19, 2023

## Description
This web application was created with the intention of giving users a minimal interface where they can add or delete sneakers they have in a collection table. The page was designed to provide a retro vaporwave aesthetic to create a feeling of nostalgia and comfort. With a focus on user experience, the straightforward functionality of the application allows for user adjustments to appear seamless and accessible.

## Getting Started
Sole Stash is a sneaker collection tracker where a user can add sneakers they have acquired into a table that lists them. Users can add sneakers using the Add Sneaker tab which redirects them to a page to provide relevant information including the name, brand, size, date acquired, notes, and a picture, which is required. After clicking the Add Sneaker button, the sneakers then appear on the redirected collection page with the corresponding details. In the details page, the user can update or delete the sneaker and add comments, upon which the user will be redirected back to the collection page with the changes made.

## Ice Box Features
Some of the enchancements I would like to add to Sole Stash are as follows:
* Allow users to update the image they have for their sneaker and add more than one image
* Add a library where users can look up different sneakers
* Provide links where users can purchase a sneaker that they want
* Permit users to buy, sell, and trade on the app
* Give users the option to bookmark sneakers
* Create a wishlist where users can add sneakers they want to have in their collection
* Grant access to metrics regarding sneakers across the app, such as the frequency of a certain sneaker in user's collections
* Add a followers function where other users can follow and interact with other users
* Optimize app design for mobile use
