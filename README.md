# Sole Stash
Developed by TJ Roncal on May 19, 2023

## Description
Sole Stash was created with the intention of giving users a minimal interface where they can add or delete sneakers they have in a collection table. The web application was given a retro aesthetic to provide a feeling of nostalgia and comfort. With a focus on user experience, the straightforward functionality allows for simple user adjustments made to be accessible and appear seamlessly.

## Getting Started
Sole Stash is a sneaker collection tracker where logged-in users can add their sneakers into a table that lists them. Users can add sneakers using the ADD SNEAKERS tab directing them to a page to provide relevant information including the name, brand, size, date acquired, notes, and a picture, which is required. After clicking the ADD SNEAKERS button, the sneakers then appear on the redirected COLLECTION home page with the corresponding details. In the DETAILS tab, users can update or delete the sneakers and add comments, which when added will redirect them back to the COLLECTION page with the changes made.

## Ice Box Features
Some of the enchancements I would like to add to Sole Stash are as follows:
* Allow users to update the image they have for their sneaker and add more than one image
* Add a library where users can look up different sneakers
* Provide links where users can purchase a sneaker that they want
* Permit users to buy, sell, and trade on the app
* Give users the option to bookmark sneakers
* Create a wishlist where users can add sneakers they want to have in their collection
* Grant access to metrics regarding sneakers across the app, such as the frequency of a certain sneaker in users' collections
* Add a followers function where other users can follow and interact with other users
* Optimize app design for mobile use
